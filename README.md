# jframos29.github.io: My own website (1st web development project)

This is my personal web page, part of the first project of Uniandes web development course (Fall 2019).In this web page I show myself and show my different projects, giving the vistors an opportunity to contact me if they are interested in them.

-----

# Project goals and technologies

In this project my goal was to practice (and increment) the skills related with HTML, CSS and Javascript (including JQuery) and also to enjoy the opportunity to explore my abilities, achievements and my projects to show them in this web page.

-----

# Prerrequisites

Given that the project is hosted in Github pages you can easily access to the project (https://jframos29.github.io) with a recent browser (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari 3+, IE 15+, Microsoft Edge 17+). However, you can clone this repository and, using npm, install reload (>npm install -g reload) (or http-server/lite-server Why not?) to host the project locally (inside the project root use >reload .).
