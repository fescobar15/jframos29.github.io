# jframos29.github.io: My own website (1st web development project)
This is my personal web page, part of the first project of Uniandes web development course (Fall 2019). 
In this project I practiced (and increment) my skills with HTML, CSS and Javascript (including JQuery) and I had the opportunity to explore my abilities, achievements and my projects to show them in this web page.
